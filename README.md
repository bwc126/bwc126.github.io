# Project-1-Portfolio

Portfolio project (Project 1) for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

Project is an exercise in learning basic HTML and CSS, while making something worth showing to other learners and those interested in seeing a progression of past work.

## Making it my own

A few months after the Udacity FEND project was successfully submitted, this site became the nucleus of my personal website. I gave it a slick, dark neon aesthetic while otherwise maintaining the minimalistic feel of the original, making a few other changes as well.

### The spotlight
Spotlight changes when the mouse enters an image for one of the projects on the page. This area also uses lower resolution images when loaded on a smaller viewport.

### The subject areas
Programming, Engineering and Science


# ToDo:
-Make the focal points and headline coherent (if I'm a Frontend Engineer, that should be the default emphasis of everything else on the page, etc.).

-Make sure each project for each subject changes the spotlight, and does so with a whole set of responsive images, utilizing 'srcset' property and the basic 'src' property.

-Resolve lack of convincing neon glow, give sufficient margins/padding/etc. for glow to extinct.

-Use a background image.

-Use some filtering to improve atmospherics.

-Reposition sections to improve presentation impact.

-Minimize number of CSS rules and classes.
