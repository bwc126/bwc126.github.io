## A Personal Showcase for Brian W Coe

This project began as an exercise in learning basic HTML and CSS, while making something worth showing to other learners and those interested in seeing a progression of prior work. It was the Front End Nanodegree project 1, in Q3/4 of 2015.

A few months after the Udacity FEND project was successfully submitted, this site became the nucleus of my personal website. I gave it a slick, dark neon aesthetic while otherwise maintaining the minimalistic feel of the original, making a few other changes as well.

Since finishing the core projects of the FEND in early Q2 of 2016, I've found the need to have an-up-to-date and comprehensive showcase of my talents. This is also in the interest of completing the career counseling portion of the FEND, and graduating the nanodegree.

### To Run
Open index.html in something later than IE8 (and hopefully not IE ;)).

## Key Features

### The spotlight
Spotlight changes when the mouse enters an image for one of the projects on the page. This area also uses lower resolution images when loaded on a smaller viewport.

### The subject areas
Programming, Engineering and Science. Key projects/points of interest from each area are detailed via a modal, with a thumbnail and larger images for each.


# ToDo:
- Make the focal points and headline coherent (if I'm a Frontend Engineer, that should be the default emphasis of everything else on the page, etc.).

- Populate content areas.

- Reposition sections to improve presentation impact.

- Resolve lack of convincing neon glow, give sufficient margins/padding/etc. for glow to extinct.

- Minimize number of CSS rules and classes.

- ~~Improve readability of font vs. background.~~

- ~~Set image alts depending on dynamic content.~~

- ~~Improve responsiveness on mobile.~~

- ~~Use some filtering to improve atmospherics~~ + ~~Use a background image~~ = perhaps a dynamic raindrop effect over a background image could do the trick?

- ~~Make sure each project for each subject changes the spotlight, and does so with a whole set of responsive images, utilizing 'srcset' property and the basic 'src' property.~~

- ~~"Fade-in" spotlight image change.~~

- ~~Use thumbnails for project images, 'src' data in the model should only apply to spotlight.~~
